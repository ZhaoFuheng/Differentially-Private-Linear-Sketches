# DPLinearSketch

All sketches in this repo are not optimized in any way, and they are prototypes to demonstrate the theoritical results.

Use the jupyter notebook to run the experiments. The Evaluation.ipynb file contains full instructions for reproducing our results.

Download the CAIDA trace files from https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_dataset/. You may need to modify the path in the jupyter notebook when reading the dataset.
